        <div style="display: flex;flex-direction: row">

        <p style="flex: 2">Our mission at TSS is to help you reach your<br>athletic goals through motivation, support, and<br>education.
            We have years of experience with<br>athletes of all ages and abilities and we're<br>happy to assist any
            athlete committed to<br>pursuing his or her dreams.<br><br>We offer one-on-one coaching, evaluation, and<br>instruction;
            but we also offer small group<br>practices. Our classes are never large in<br>number. We believe that a
            low coach-to-athlete<br>ratio provides the best results in the shortest<br>time.<br><br>Come in and
            introduce yourself to our team of coaches and educators.</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;font:10pt Verdana;color: white;background-color: #d1894a;flex: 1">"I have been given great
            feedback and encouragement by the TSS coaches. This last winter I took part in the Winter Cycling class and
            it made a huge difference to my spring rides. The coaches are caring professionals and they know their
            business."

        <h2 style="background-color: beige;color: orangered">Simal Green</h2>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">MA, CSCS, USAT Level II Coach</p>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">Exercise Physiologist and Biomechanic Specialist</p>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">Owner of Tri and Succeed Sports</p>

        <img style="float: left; padding:0 1rem 1rem 0" src="images/coach1.png" height="250px" width="200px">
        <p>Simal brings an extensive background in physiology and biomechanics to TSS and 18 years of experience
            coaching in the health and fitness field. She is a USA Triathlon Level II Certified coach and is
            certified in strength, conditioning, and bike fitting. Before founding Tri and Succeed Sports, Simal
            built a private training studio for local athletes.</p>
        <p>Simal was a lettered volleyball player at the University of Texas and she picked up the sport of
            triathlon after graduation. Triathlons have been her passion ever since. She has competed in many
            short- to long-distance running, cycling, and triathlon events including multiple races in IM Texas,
            IM Brazil, and IM Chicago.</p>
        <p>Simal wants to provide personalized instruction to her athletes. She believes an educated athlete is
            an athlete primed for success. Under her instruction, you will learn not only what to do but why to
            do it.</p>

        <h2 style="background-color: beige;color: orangered;clear: left">Kevin Hughes</h2>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">BS, USAT Level I</p>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">Kinesiologist</p>

        <img style="float: left; padding:0 1rem 1rem 0" src="images/coach2.png">
        <p>Kevin is a student of body mechanics. In addition to a Bachelor's degree in Kinesiology, Kevin brings
            certification in Swim Instruction and coaching. He has coached numerous recreational and elite
            athletes, including Sprint and Ironman triathletes.</p>
        <p>In addition to coaching individual athletes, Kevin has coached a variety of teams and groups. Kevin
            coached Swimming and Cross Country at Austin High School and Palmer Country Day School. As Head
            Coach, his swim teams set school records in 9 out of 11 events, won the Mid-Texas Conference
            Championship, and consistently finished in the top 3 at the Small School State meet. Kevin currently
            coaches the Masters swim classes at TSS.</p>
        <p>Since being talked into his first triathlon at 16, Kevin has always enjoyed the challenge the sport
            provides. His motivation comes from the desire to improve himself, not the desire to beat others.
            Starting as a middle of the pack athlete, his initial goal was to work his way through the distances
            which culminated with an Ironman finish in 2010. Bill remains a student of the sport while helping
            others achieve their fitness and racing goals.</p>
        <h2 style="background-color: beige;color: orangered;clear: left">Tammy Whitmore</h2>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">USAT Level I</p>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">Certified Triathlon Trainer</p>
        <p><img src="images/check.png">Certified Nutritionist</p>
        <img style="float: left; padding:0 1rem 1rem 0" src="images/coach3.png">
        <p>Fitness has always been a part of Tammy's life. Whether it was running, cycling, or strength
            conditioning she has dedicated herself to fitness and a healthy lifestyle. Trained as a mechanical
            designer, Tammy has designed commercial strength products used in health clubs around the country.
            Her interests led her to TSS, first as one of our athletes and then, 4 years ago, as a member of the
            staff.</p>
        <p>After completing her USAT certification training, Tammy designed the course of workouts we use with
            our runners and cyclists. Tammy is also our nutritionist; she believes that reaching one's fitness
            goals requires a holistic approach in which what goes into the body is as important as what comes
            out.</p>
        <p>Coming from an engineering background, Tammy looks at things from an analytical point of view.
            Recently Tammy completed two seminars on cycling with power meters. Tammy believes in continuing
            education and has set her sights on receiving her USAT Level II certification and USAT youth
            coaching certification.</p>
